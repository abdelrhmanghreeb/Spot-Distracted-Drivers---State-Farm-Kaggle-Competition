# Spot-Distracted-Drivers---State-Farm-Kaggle-Competition
State farm posted a competition on Kaggle to spot different 10 types of unsafe driving attitudes. In this project, I try to reach competitive results to those on the leader board of the competition. Using convolutional neural network based model, alongside with data augmentation, dropout, and pseudo labeling, we were able to reach very competitive results in this typical image classification problem. Because I have had no access to capable gpu at this time, I experimented on just small sample of the whole data and appended Jermey Howard's results to my notebook to give a sense on results that can be easily reached.
